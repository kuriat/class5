                <h2>Facts about the Solar System</h2>
                <p>
                    Our solar system includes the Sun, eight planets, five officially named dwarf planets, and hundreds of moons, and
                    thousands of asteroids and comets. Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major
                    arms, and two minor arms. Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur,
                    between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000
                    kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.

                    Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our
                    star, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis."
